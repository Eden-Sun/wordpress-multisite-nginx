# FFI Implementation Changes Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from Alpine-based WordPress image to Debian-based image with FFI extension enabled.

## Files Created

### 1. Dockerfile
**Location**: `/home/r7/witsper/wordpress-docker-compose/Dockerfile`
**Purpose**: Custom WordPress build with FFI extension
**Key Changes**:
- Base image: `wordpress:fpm` (Debian-based, not Alpine)
- Installed `libffi-dev` package
- Built and enabled FFI extension via `docker-php-ext-install`
- Copied custom PHP and PHP-FPM configurations

### 2. php.ini
**Location**: `/home/r7/witsper/wordpress-docker-compose/php.ini`
**Purpose**: Custom PHP configuration
**Key Settings**:
- `memory_limit = 512M` (increased from default 128M)
- `max_execution_time = 300` (5 minutes for long operations)
- `ffi.enable = "true"` (enables FFI extension)
- Opcache enabled with optimized settings
- Error logging configured

### 3. php-fpm.conf
**Location**: `/home/r7/witsper/wordpress-docker-compose/php-fpm.conf`
**Purpose**: PHP-FPM process manager configuration
**Key Settings**:
- `pm = dynamic` (dynamic process management)
- `pm.max_children = 20` (max PHP workers)
- `pm.start_servers = 4` (initial workers)
- `request_terminate_timeout = 300s` (matches PHP timeout)

## Files Modified

### 1. docker-compose.yml
**Changes**:
- Replaced `image: wordpress:fpm-alpine` with custom build directive
- Added `build: context: .` and `dockerfile: Dockerfile`
- Fixed wpcli user to `33:33` for proper permissions

### 2. nginx.conf
**Changes**:
- Added FastCGI timeout settings (300s)
- Added buffer size configurations for better performance
- Increased buffer sizes for handling large requests

### 3. README.md
**Changes**:
- Added PHP version and FFI extension documentation
- Expanded WP-CLI usage examples
- Added troubleshooting section for FFI errors
- Documented multisite super admin commands

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: PHP-FPM was crashing with SIGSEGV (segmentation fault) errors when FFI extension was enabled on Alpine Linux.

**Root Cause**: FFI extension has compatibility issues with Alpine Linux (musl libc) when used in forked PHP-FPM processes.

**Solution**: Switched to Debian-based WordPress image which uses glibc, providing better FFI stability.

## Verification Steps

1. Check FFI is loaded:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec wordpress php -m | grep FFI
   ```

2. Check PHP configuration:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec wordpress php -i | grep -E "ffi|memory_limit"
   ```

3. Verify no segfaults:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs wordpress | grep -i "signal\|segv"
   ```

4. Test site is responding:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://192.168.1.55
   ```

## Performance Notes

- Memory limit increased to 512M for handling large operations
- Execution timeout set to 300 seconds for long-running scripts
- PHP-FPM configured with 20 max children to handle concurrent requests
- Nginx buffers optimized for FastCGI communication
- Opcache enabled to improve PHP performance

## Next Steps

1. Test your witsper_go_ffi plugin functionality
2. Monitor PHP-FPM logs for any memory issues
3. Adjust pm.max_children if needed based on load
4. Consider adding health checks to docker-compose.yml
5. Update production deployment with these changes
